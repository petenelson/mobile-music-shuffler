			<h3>About This App</h3>
			<p>
				My Nexus One is the primary music player I use while I drive.  I typically put all my songs on shuffle, hit play and skip through until I find something I like.  	
				The built-in player that comes with Android has pretty small buttons and it's tricky to hit these while driving without taking your eyes off the road to hit the right button.  
				I needed a music player with huge buttons.  
				<span class="bold">HUGE.</span>
			</p>

			<p>
				There are a couple existing Android apps that have large buttons, but nothing that suited my needs.  I wanted a simple music player with large buttons that shuffled through 
				all my songs so it's easy to use while I drive.  So, since I'm a software developer, I decided to write my own, which gives me an app that does exactly what I want and lets me learn Android development in the process.
			</p>

			<p>
				PLEASE send me feeback if you run into any problems.  Be sure to include the type of phone/tablet you'e on, the version of Android and
				as much info on what you were doing in the app when you encountered the issue.  Send feedback to <a href="mailto:pete@petenelson.com?Subject=Mobile Music Shuffler Feedback">pete@petenelson.com</a>.

			<h3>Overview</h3>


				<div id="appOverviewMain">
					<h4>Main Screen</h4>

					Launching the Mobile Music Shuffler presents the main user interface.  On startup, it will load all the music available on your phone and shuffle the list for playback.  
					It works in either orientation.  

				
					I personally use it by putting my phone in a cupholder, so it's typically in landscape thus making the Next button quite prominent.
			
					<br /><br />

					From left-to-right:
					<ul>
						<li>Previous Song: If the player is paused, it will go to the previous song.  If it's playing, it will go back to the beginning of the song, unless you are two seconds or
						less into the song, then it will go the previous song. Swipe Gesture: Right-to-left</li>
						<li>
							Play/Pause: Plays or pauses the current song. Swipe Gesture: up and down like a letter V
						</li>
						<li>
							Next Song: A regular press goes to the next song.  A long press will go to the next song by the same artist.  Swipe Gesture: Left-to-right
						</li>
						<li>
							Other swipe gestures:  Draw a circle to reload all songs.  Draw a zig-zag (letter Z) to bring up playlists.
						</li>

					</ul>
				
					

					If a song is playing and you hit the Back or Home button on your phone, the song will continue playing and a notification will be displayed with the title and artist allowing you
					to get back to the app. If a song is not being played, hitting the back button will "exit" the application and clear any notification.

					<br /><br />


					In the lower-left, it shows you how many songs are loaded.  In the lower-right, it shows you the current song's position and duration.

					<h4>Gestures</h4>

					By default, gesstures are enabled but can be configured to your liking or turned off entirely.  Check the Settings menu for customizations.
					<br />

					Left-to-right (next song) or right-to-left (previous song)
					<div class="center">
						<img src="gesture-left-to-right.png" alt="" class="center" />

					<br />
					Right arrow (next song by same artist)
					<div class="center">
						<img src="gesture-right-arrow.png" alt="" class="center" />
					</div>

					<br />
					<br />
					Down arrow (play/pause)
					<div class="center">

					<br />
					Zigzag (playlists)
					<div class="center">
						<img src="gesture-zigzag.png" alt="" class="center" />
					</div>

					<br />
					<br />
					Circle (all songs)
					<div class="center">

					</div>

				<br />

				<div id="appOverviewSearch">

					<h4>Search</h4>

					Hitting the search button will bring up a search dialog.  Don't do this while you're driving.  
					<div class="center">
					<img  src="search-dialog-initial.png" alt="" />
					</div>

					<br /><br />

					The search function combines the artist and title and then looks for all the keywords you entered in that combination.  Let's see what sort of
					Frank Sinatra we have.  
					<br /><br />
					<div class="center">
						<img  src="search-dialog-one-word.png" alt="" />
					</div>
					<br /><br />

					Well, maybe we want Relax by Frankie Goes to Hollywood instead.  We don't need to type Frankie, just the first part of Relax to filter the list even further.
					<br /><br />
					<div class="center">
					<img  src="search-dialog-multi-words-01.png" alt="" />
					</div>
					<br /><br />

					You don't even need to use full words.  It will do partial word searches as well.  Let's find Crush 'Em by Megadeth.
					<br /><br />
					<div class="center">
					<img  src="search-dialog-multi-words-02.png" alt="" />
					</div>

					<br /><br />

					Clicking Go will bring up a full list of matches.  If I search for Cash, you'll see I'm a big fan of the man in black.
					<br /><br />
					<div class="center">
					<img  src="search-dialog-all-matches.png" alt="" />
					</div>

					<br /><br />

					Clicking on a match in any of these screens will start playing the song right away.

			<h3>What It Does't Do</h3>

			Since I wrote this for the way I listen to music while I drive (everything on shuffle), it doesn't do:

				<ul>
					<li>Album Art</li>
					<li>Album Names</li>
				</ul>

				That's not saying I won't add some of these functions in future versions, but for now, these aren't included.
